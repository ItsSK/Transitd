# Mesh Network Internet Gateway System
Mnigs is an automated Internet gateway publish, search and connect tool for community networks.

The goal of this package is to provide to gateway operators the ability to automatically run and advertise their gateway on the network and to provide to subscribers the automated gateway search and connect functionality.

Emerging community mesh networks seek to provide free and open access to a network built by its users.  Implementations of such networks may not necessarily povide transit to the rest of the Internet.  Access to the traditional Internet has a recurring cost (paid to transit providers), which someone has to pay.  In the case where someone does pay for it, service type/quality may not suit all users.  This makes Internet access incompatible with the open/free nature of community networks.  In most cases, one cannot simply assume that access to such networks will grant them access to the traditional Internet.  There may be multiple available Internet gateways on a particular community network, some free of charge to use and some that may come at a cost.  In all cases, setting up connection to the traditional Internet through community network gateways is a manual process.  Mnigs makes the process of getting and having Internet access via a community network easy.

### Warning:  code in this repository is work in progress and currently not usable, feel free to contribute.

## Main Advantages
* Decentralized (uses routing tables to do breadth first search for mnigs servers)
* Supports multiple routing protocols
* Supports multiple connection methods
* Automatically registers with available servers and sets up WAN

## Gateway Component
* config file
  * JSON RPC ports
  * interfaces to run on and routing protocols to use
  * terms of access (max subscribers, etc)
* gateway server support
  * openvpn/softether
  * ipip/gre
  * cjdns gateway
  * simple default gateway configuration (in Layer 2 networks)
  * tun2socks?
  * other methods
* HTTP JSON RPC server
* JSON input/output

### Function
1. set up external routing system(s): locally running VPN server software, etc.
2. start JSON RPC server
  a. serve available connection details to subscribers
  b. allow subscribers to register/unregister with the server

## Subscriber Component
* config file
  * JSON RPC ports
  * interfaces to scan and routing protocols to use
  * IP scan methods
  * connection methods
  * connection method specific configuration
* subscriber support for all the connection methods supported by the server
* support traversing network for multiple routing protocols, including cjdns

### Function
  1. traverse the network to find nodes
  2. send JSON RPC request to configured port(s) that servers run on
  3. register with the server over JSON RPC if connection is possible
  4. set up connection with the appropriate method, retry with different methods on failure
  5. detect downtime and search for another server, track connection quality of servers

## Dependencies
* lua >= 5.1
* luasocket
* cgilua
* lua-cjson
* inifile
* xavante
* wsapi-xavante
* jsonrpc4lua
* sha2
* bencode
* dkjson (cjdns lua library code dependency)
* bit32
* luasql-sqlite3
* alt-getopt
* luaproc

A fix is required to allow CGILua to accept JSON-RPC content type (see https://github.com/keplerproject/cgilua/pull/9).  The fix has been merged into CGILua master branch, however, no stable release is available as of this writing.

A fix is required to allow JSON RPC requests to work with IPv6 (see https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket/pull/91).  A more permanent fix has been merged into luasocket master branch, however, no stable release is available as of this writing.

## Installation

### Docker Installation
```
$ git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/pdxmeshnet/mnigs.git
$ cd mnigs
$ docker build -t "mnigs:0" .
$ docker run -it --privileged --rm mnigs:0
```

### Manual Installation
```
$ git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/pdxmeshnet/mnigs.git
$ cd mnigs
$ sudo luarocks install cgilua
$ sudo luarocks install lua-cjson
$ sudo luarocks install inifile
$ sudo luarocks install xavante
$ sudo luarocks install wsapi-xavante
$ sudo luarocks install jsonrpc4lua
$ sudo luarocks install sha2
$ sudo luarocks install bencode
$ sudo luarocks install dkjson
$ sudo luarocks install bit32
$ sudo luarocks install alt-getopt
$ sudo luarocks install luaproc
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
$ sudo luarocks install luasql-sqlite3
$ sudo patch -p0 /usr/share/lua/5.1/cgilua/post.lua patches/cgilua-content-type-fix.patch
```
Then, either,
```
$ sudo patch -p0 /usr/share/lua/5.1/socket/http.lua patches/luasocket-ipv6-fix.patch
```
OR (unstable luasocket version)
```
$ sudo luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegonehab/luasocket/master/luasocket-scm-0.rockspec
```
If you are using --local flag with luarocks, make sure you have ``` eval `luarocks path` ``` in your .bashrc file.

## Configuration
```
$ cd mnigs
$ cp mnigs.conf.sample mnigs.conf
$ vi mings.conf
```
Add path to your cjdroute.conf config file in the [cjdns] section.

## Usage

### Run daemon
```
$ cd src
$ lua daemon.lua
```

### Run command line interface
```
$ cd src
$ lua cli.lua
```

### Web UI
You can access `http://localhost:65533` from your browser.

## Demo usage on a single host with CJDNS
In order to demo the system, you actually need 2 different machines.  You can avoid this by using 2 different config files running mnigs on different ports and different database file.

### Start daemon 1
```
$ cd src
$ cp mnigs.conf.sample mnigs1.conf
$ vi mnigs1.conf
set cjdns.config=....
set daemon.rpcport=65533
set gateway.enabled=yes
set database.file=mnigs1.db
$ lua daemon.lua -f ../mnigs1.conf
```

### Start daemon 2
```
$ cd src
$ cp mnigs.conf.sample mnigs2.conf
$ vi mnigs2.conf
set cjdns.config=....
set daemon.rpcport=65534
set gateway.enabled=no
set database.file=mnigs2.db
$ lua daemon.lua -f ../mnigs2.conf
```

### Trigger network scan
```
$ cd src
$ lua cli.lua -f ../mnigs2.conf -s
```

### Trigger connection
```
$ cd src
$ lua cli.lua -f ../mnigs2.conf -c <YOUR CJDNS IP> -p 65533
```

## Design
Each node runs a daemon.  The daemon sends and receives messages over HTTP JSON RPC interface.  The web UI is also available over HTTP.  Subscribers can request connections with gateways.  Connection sessions have a short lifetime and need to be renewed.  The daemon manages networking configuration on both ends, which can be adjusted in the configuration file.
Knowledge of available gateways on a network is gained by occasionally scanning the network and adding the new information into the DHT.

### Protocol

The following RPC functions are available.

- nodeInfo()
- requestConnection(sid, name, port, method, options)
- renewConnection(sid)
- releaseConnection(sid)

In case of success, the following object is returned,
```
{ success: true, .... }
```

In case of error, the following object is returned,
```
{ success: false, errorMsg: "...." }
```
